            <h5 class="card-title">Finding remote work in 2022</h5>
            <p class="card-text"></p>
            A few years back I wrote how to find remote work in 2019 after a
            personal research of having to find a remote work for the first time
            not by being approached by a headhunter, but on my own. That article
            did better than a lot of other things I've written. However,
            recently I had to hire people about of a very very early stage
            startup (the very first hires other than the co-founders), and
            noticed the list and feedback I had on my original article needed
            some updates, especially with the business world embracing the
            remote work more and more after the pandemic. So here they are - in
            this article I'll cover the most popular platforms I've noticed as
            being used and their pros and cons and in another one I'll cover the
            perspective of someone looking to hire and the pros and cons of the
            platforms then, as they more often than not are quite different. We
            Work Remotely Still my favorite several years later! I've found most
            of my job opportunities through WWR. Pros +All companies I have
            contacted for job postings on this website were fast to +respond.
            +All had a quickly moving hiring process. +It has several types of
            jobs - marketing, programming, etc. +It also has the benefit of
            showing where candidates must be located for the job. +It has kept
            growing over the years. It now has 28,530 postings Cons -It doesn't
            allow for an easy apply like other entries on the list. -The
            increased number of companies leads to a bit of a dilution of how
            often companies reply and how quick their process is. -There is no
            streamlined way of applying for a job. The button for applying can
            lead to anywhere - outside platforms or even just email addresses
            without any guidance on what information is of interest to the
            company. Remote Tech Jobs Built as a replacement of Stack Overflow
            jobs, based on their description. Pros +It has much better filtering
            capabilities than other options, to find what you are looking for
            +All jobs get taken down after 30 days at most, ensuring fresh
            listings. +Has a lot of open opportunities. Almost 5 000 at the time
            of writing, which when the previous point is considered is a lot of
            activity from companies looking for candidates. +Has an easy-apply
            option. Cons -They also aggregate jobs from 11 other platforms,
            aiming to be the go to place for finding remote work. However, when
            tested with several postings from We Work Remotely, they didn't
            appear in the results of Remote Tech Jobs. LinkedIn Pros +The most
            obvious candidate for everyone. +The number of companies looking to
            hire through LinkedIn has increased over the last several years.
            +Has an easy-apply for a lot of the open positions +Can filter by
            location as well (in case you need/want to go to an office as well
            or are looking for a simpler legal process (when both you and your
            employer are in the same country), or if you are just considering
            moving there) +Can easily research the company's profile right there
            in LinkedIn, including for active or past connections to get some
            inside information Cons -It still has mostly permanent positions -A
            lot of early-stage startups don't post on LinkedIn while they are
            still in stealth mode, so if you are interested to be one of the
            first hires at a company, other entries such as AngelList or
            HackerNews would be better options AngelList Pros +Has a lot of
            active listings +Companies are required to list their salary range
            for the posting, so there is less of a chance of surprises
            +Companies also list expected bonuses in terms of stock options +Has
            a streamlined application process Cons -There is a lot of
            competition especially because of the easy application process so
            you'll need to stand out -Most of the companies on AngelList are
            early stage start ups. This can be viewed as a benefit for some
            people as well Otta Pros +Each company posting jobs at Otta is
            screened by them so the quality feels a lot better than some other
            platforms +Extremely good filtering +Streamlined application process
            Cons -Lower number of overall job postings
